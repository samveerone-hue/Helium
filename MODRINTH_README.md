## ⚡ Features

**Distance Culling**
Skip rendering stuff that's too far away. Entities, block entities (chests, signs, etc), and particles all get culled based on distance. You set the range per type.

**Faster Math**
Replaces Minecraft's trig functions with lookup tables and faster approximations. Runs throughout the entire renderer every frame.

**GL State Caching**
Tracks what OpenGL state is already set and skips redundant calls. Less driver overhead, smoother frames.

**Memory Pooling**
Reuses objects instead of creating new ones. Less garbage collection, fewer stutters.

**Server List Speed**
Pings all your servers at once instead of one by one. Way faster to see which servers are online.

**Scroll Position**
When you refresh the server list, it remembers where you scrolled. Small thing but its nice.

| **Sodium** | Required. Helium's settings live here |
| **Lithium** | Works great. Lithium does game logic, Helium does rendering |
