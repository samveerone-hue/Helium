> this is the **development repository** for Helium. if you're just looking to install the mod, grab it from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/heliummc). the page there has all the feature descriptions and pretty screenshots and stuff.

## Building From Source

you'll need **Java 25** installed. that's it. gradle wrapper handles everything else.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qborder/Helium.git
cd Helium
```

**build the mod:**
```bash
./gradlew remapJar
```

output jar lands in `build/libs/`. the one *without* `-dev` in the name is the one you want.

**run a dev client** (for testing):
```bash
./gradlew runClient
```

**generate IDE sources** (IntelliJ / Eclipse):
```bash
./gradlew genSources
```

then import as a Gradle project. IntelliJ will figure it out.

## Contributing

PRs welcome. if you're fixing a bug, please describe what was broken and why. if you're adding a feature, open an issue first so we don't waste each other's time.

the codebase uses **official Mojang names** (Minecraft 26.1+ ships de-obfuscated, so there is no Yarn mapping set) and targets **Minecraft 26.1.x** with **Fabric Loader 0.19+**.

fair warning: the mixin naming convention uses `helium$` prefix for all injected methods. keep it consistent.
