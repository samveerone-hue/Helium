## Rentities / GPU Entity Batching Fixes

The `1.21.11` branch includes the current Rentities integration work and the following fixes:

- **Armor Stand render-state population fixed.** Rentities previously set the Armor Stand flag but did not populate the six per-instance pose slots used by the GPU shader. The render path now copies head, body, left/right arm, and left/right leg rotations from `ArmorStandEntityRenderState` into the instance buffer. citeturn597048search1turn597048search6
- **Armor Stand yaw fixed.** The Rentities instance now uses the Armor Stand render state's authoritative `yaw` when writing the GPU rotation, keeping it aligned with the existing `180 - yaw` shader transform. citeturn597048search6
- **Armor Stand head pivot fixed.** The missing per-instance head pivot is now populated for the baked entity coordinate system so head rotations use the correct rotation centre.
- **Armor Stand state mixin enabled.** The new `RentitiesArmorStandStateMixin` is registered in the client mixin configuration so the fix is actually applied at runtime.
- **GPU batching fallback hardened.** Standard SSBO uploads remain the default backend, while indirect/culling failures fall back to normal ordered instanced rendering instead of silently dropping entities.
- **Entity error fallback retained.** Failed entity mesh paths can use the magenta error renderer while the normal queue remains available for recovery.
- **Queue rollback/compaction hardened.** Failed direct extraction reservations are removed safely and cancelled queue slots are compacted before drawing.

These fixes are intended to keep Rentities visually consistent with vanilla rendering while retaining the performance benefits of GPU entity batching.

> **Verification status:** the Armor Stand state fix is committed, but the `1.21.11` GitHub Actions build still needs to complete before this is considered CI-verified.

## Building From Source

you'll need **Java 21** installed. that's it. gradle wrapper handles everything else.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qborder/Helium.git
cd Helium
```

**build the mod:**
```bash
./gradlew remapJar
```

output jar lands in `build/libs/`. the one *without* `-dev` in the name is the one you want.

**run a dev client** (for testing):
```bash
./gradlew runClient
```

**generate IDE sources** (IntelliJ / Eclipse):
```bash
./gradlew genSources
```

then import as a Gradle project. IntelliJ will figure it out.

## Contributing

PRs welcome. if you're fixing a bug, please describe what was broken and why. if you're adding a feature, open an issue first so we don't waste each other's time.

the codebase uses **Yarn mappings** and targets **Minecraft 1.21.x** with **Fabric Loader 0.16+**.

fair warning: the mixin naming convention uses `helium$` prefix for all injected methods. keep it consistent.
